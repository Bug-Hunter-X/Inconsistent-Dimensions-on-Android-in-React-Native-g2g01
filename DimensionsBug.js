This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` methods might return incorrect or inconsistent values, particularly when the app is launched or when the device orientation changes.  The issue might be intermittent and not reproducible consistently, making it hard to debug.  The dimensions might be smaller than expected, completely wrong, or even zero in some cases.
